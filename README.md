This repository contains documents relating to my work on the final project of the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.  The course is part of the Data Science specialization.  
The object of the “project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set” (Coursera course website).
Included are the following docs:
1.	Code book that briefly describes the data and links to the original data and external website with more detailed description.
2.	RMarkdown report that sets out the steps and code used to create the final data set from the original files.
3.	R script that contains all the code necessary to output the final dataframe.
4.	Text file that shows a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
